# RespawnTimer
A SCP: Secret Laboratory plugin that shows when the next respawn wave will happen.

# Features
- Fully customizable timer that may show additional info, like round time, server TPS, amount of spectators, enabled generators etc.
- Option for adding multiple custom text (hints) to the interface, where you can put advertisements and/or gameplay hints for players.
- Option for hiding the timer interface (**.timer** command in client console)
- Option for hiding the timer interface if admin is using Overwatch mode (enabled by default)
- Support for [Serpent's Hand](https://github.com/Exiled-Team/SerpentsHand) and [UIURescueSquad](https://github.com/Marco15453/UIURescueSquad) custom teams.

# Configuration
When you first install the plugin, the `ExampleTimer` folder will be automatically downloaded. You are free to edit the config files inside this directory as you see fit. You can change how the timer looks like, hints etc. Removing `ExampleTimer` folder will redownload it once again after server restart.
